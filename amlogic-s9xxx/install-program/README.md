# install-program

Install and Upgrading openwrt to the emmc for S9xxx-Boxs.

## Instructions

1. `svn co https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/trunk/amlogic-s9xxx/install-program package/install-program`
2. Execute make `menuconfig` and select `install-program` under `Utilities`

```shell script
Utilities  --->  
   <*> install-program
```
ðŸ’¡Tips: This installation and upgrade script can be introduced and used separately during github.com online compilation. If the firmware in the `openwrt-armvirt` directory you provided does not integrate this installation and upgrade script, ***`Will auto add`*** this function to you through the `./make` script when packaging.

## Install to S9xxx-Boxs EMMC partition and upgrade instructions

Choose the corresponding firmware according to your box. Then write the IMG file to the USB hard disk through software such as [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Insert the USB hard disk into the S9xxx-Boxs.

Common for `Phicomm-n1` and `s9xxx-Boxes`, etc.

***`Install OpenWrt`***

- Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’ `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command: 

```yaml
s9xxx-install.sh
reboot
```

When writing into EMMC through [s9xxx-install.sh](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/amlogic-s9xxx/install-program/files/s9xxx-install.sh), `select the name` of the box you own in the menu.

For more OpenWrt firmware .dtb files are in the [amlogic-dtb](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/amlogic-s9xxx/amlogic-dtb) directory. You can use the `openwrt_s905x3_v*.img` firmware to install via USB hard disk. When writing into EMMC through [s9xxx-install.sh](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/amlogic-s9xxx/install-program/files/s9xxx-install.sh), [select 0: Enter the dtb file name of your box](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/amlogic-s9xxx/amlogic-dtb), and use the S9xxx-Boxes you own.

***`Upgrading OpenWrt`***

- Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `file transfer` â†’ upload ***`openwrt*.img.gz (Support suffix: *.img.xz, *.img.gz, *.7z)`*** to ***`/tmp/upload/`***, enter the `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command: 

```yaml
s9xxx-update.sh
reboot
```
You can also put the upgrade file in the `/mnt/mmcblk*p4/` directory, the `s9xxx-update.sh` script will automatically find the upgrade file from the `/mnt/mmcblk*p4/` and `/tmp/upload/` directories, and the supported suffixes are `*.img, *.img.xz, *.img.gz, *.7z`
    
Tips: If there is only one `.img` file in the ***`/mnt/mmcblk*p4/`*** directory, you can just enter the ***`s9xxx-update.sh`*** command without specifying a specific file name. The upgrade script will vaguely look for `.img` files from the fixed directory and try to upgrade. If there are multiple `.img` files in the ***`/mnt/mmcblk*p4/`*** directory, please use the ***`s9xxx-update.sh your_openwrt_imgFileName.img`*** command to specify the firmware upgrade.

***`Write bootloader`***

If your box is X96-Max+, you must write the bootloader of HK1-Box included in the firmware to EMMC before it can be gigabit. This step is now integrated into the installation script and is automatically completed during installation:

```shell script
dd if=/root/hk1box-bootloader.img  of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1 count=442 conv=fsync 2>/dev/null
dd if=/root/hk1box-bootloader.img  of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=512 skip=1 seek=1 conv=fsync 2>/dev/null
sync
reboot
```

If the Phicomm-n1 partition fails and cannot be written, you can restore the bootloader, restart it, and run the relevant command again.
```shell script
dd if=/root/u-boot-2015-phicomm-n1.bin of=/dev/mmcblk1
sync
reboot
```

You can refer to the [dtb library](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/amlogic-s9xxx/amlogic-dtb) when you customize the file name.

## Turn on the USB disk boot mode of the s9xxx-boxs

- Open the developer mode: Settings â†’ About this machine â†’ Version number (for example: X96max plus...), click on the version number for 7 times in quick succession, and you will see that the developer mode is turned on.
- Turn on USB debugging: After restarting, enter Settings â†’ System â†’ Advanced options â†’ Developer options again (after entering, confirm that the status is on, and the USB debugging status in the list is also on)
- Boot from USB hard disk: Unplug the power â†’ insert the USB hard disk â†’ insert the thimble into the AV port (top reset button) â†’ insert the power â†’ release the thimble of the av port â†’ the system will boot from the USB hard disk.
- Log in to the system: Connect the computer and the s9xxx box with a network interface â†’ turn off the wireless wifi on the computer â†’ enable the wired connection â†’ manually set the computer ip to the same network segment ip as openwrt, ipaddr such as `192.168.1.2`. The netmask is `255.255.255.0`, and others are not filled in. You can log in to the openwrt system from the browser, Enter OpwnWrt's IP Address: `192.168.1.1`, Account: `root`, Password: `password`, and then log in OpenWrt system.
