# OpenWrt for Amlogic S9xxx STB

You can modify the configuration file, [customize the OpenWrt firmware](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/router_config/Documentation.md).

## Related script usage instructions

There are currently two DIY scripts in the root directory of the warehouse: `diy-part1.sh`, `diy-part2.sh` and `.config`, which are executed before and after the update and installation of ` ./scripts/feeds update && ./scripts/feeds install `. You can write the instructions for modifying the source code into the script, such as modifying `the default IP , Host name, theme, add/remove software package...`, etc. If the additional software package has the same name as the existing software package in the OpenWrt source code, the software package with the same name in the OpenWrt source code needs to be deleted, otherwise the packages in OpenWrt will be compiled first. It will automatically traverse all files in the `package` directory when compiling.


Just put the `feeds.conf.default` file into the root directory of the warehouse, it will overwrite the relevant files in the OpenWrt source directory. Create a new `files` directory under the root directory of the warehouse, and put the customized related files in the same directory structure as OpenWrt, and the OpenWrt configuration will be overwritten during compilation.


On the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/actions) page. Select ***`Build OpenWrt`*** in the list on the left, and Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button on the right. Set ***`SSH connection to Actions: true`*** to use tmate to connect to the `GitHub Actions` virtual server environment. You can directly perform the `make menuconfig` operation to generate the compilation configuration, or any customized operation. After triggering the workflow, wait for the `SSH connection to Actions` step to be executed on the `Actions` page, and then the following three lines of messages will be displayed: 1.` To connect to this session copy-n-paste the following into a terminal or browser`, 2.***` ssh Y26QenMRd@nyc1.tmate.io `***, 3.***` https://tmate.io/t/Y26QenMRd `***. Then copy the `SSH connection command` and paste it into `the terminal` for execution, or copy `the link` to open it in `the browser` and use `the web terminal`. enter the command: ***` cd openwrt && make menuconfig `*** for personalized configuration (The web terminal may encounter a black screen, just press ***`Ctrl+C`***). After completion, press the shortcut key ***` Ctrl+D `*** or execute the ***` exit `*** command to exit, and the subsequent compilation work will proceed automatically.
